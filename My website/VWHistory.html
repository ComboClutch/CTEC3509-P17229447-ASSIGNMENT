      <h1>Volkswagen Beetle </h1>
      <p> The need for a people's car (Volkswagen in German, and in the English-speaking world
        in the early 20th century as "folk's wagon"), its concept and its functional objectives
        were formulated by the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, who wanted a cheap, simple car to
        be mass-produced for his country's new road network (Reichsautobahn).

    <p> Volkswagen returned to motorsport in 2018 by unveiling its all-electric I.D. R.
      At the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, Romain Dumas set an all-time course
      record of just under eight minutes driving the I.D. R. In September 2018,
      Volkswagen announced that it would discontinue production of the Beetle (A5) in 2019.
      Also in September 2018, Volkswagen announced its $100 million investment in
      Silicon Valley-based solid-state battery startup QuantumScape, becoming the startup's
      largest automotive investor and gaining representation on its board.</p>
