    <h2>Lamborghini</h2>
    <p>Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A.
      in 1963 to compete with established marques, including Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine,
      rear-wheel drive. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade,
      but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.
      The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group
      where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. </p>

    <h2>Porsche</h2>
    <p>Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" in 1931, with main offices at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.
      Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name.
      One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people,
      that is a "Volkswagen". This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.
      The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle. </p>

    <h2>Audi</h2>
    <p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke)
      founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932.
      The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.
      After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969,
      thus creating the present day form of the company. </p>

    <h2>Bugatti</h2>
    <p>The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the marque, and the death of his son Jean Bugatti in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory.
      No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in 1963.
      In the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive sports cars. Today, the name is owned by the Volkswagen Group.</p>

    <h2>Bentley</h2>
    <p>The joining and eventual separation of Bentley and Rolls-Royce followed a series of mergers and acquisitions, beginning with the 1931 purchase by Rolls-Royce of Bentley,
      then in receivership. In 1971, Rolls-Royce itself was forced into receivership and the UK government nationalised the company—splitting into two companies the aerospace division
      (Rolls-Royce Plc) and automotive (Rolls-Royce Motors Limited) divisions—the latter retaining the Bentley subdivision. Rolls-Royce Motors was subsequently sold to engineering conglomerate,
      Vickers and in 1998, Vickers sold Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen AG.</p>
