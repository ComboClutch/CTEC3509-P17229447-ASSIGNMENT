Repository for CTEC3509 Front End Web Development

This a Volkwagen Group fan site with information about various models
and general VW information including history, owned brands in the group and more.

For this assignment I used a combination of the examples given in Labs and https://www.w3schools.com to create the final submission displaying the use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Throughout the website I have used external links such as Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter.

The biggest I learnt was that I wasn't using github at all in the beginning, which when my website would break let to a lot of frustrating hours, as I had no previous working version to return too.
